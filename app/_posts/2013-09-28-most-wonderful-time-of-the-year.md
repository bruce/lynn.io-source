So, this is my yearly refresh of my website and the promise that I will blog more. I really do have good intentions, I just never feel qualified to write about
anything.

I have a couple things left to work on the site:

* Responsiveness ... it looks shit on mobile/smaller screens
* Animating my svg character that Meghan Schofield did for me <3
* Figuring out how how pagination is going to work/look... but I figured I might as well save that one until I get to a place where I need it ;)

I have moved away from wordpress to [Jekyll][jekyll] and hosting this site now on [GitHub Pages][github-pages], which is probably something I will write about at some point as I went through many iterations of how I wanted to do that and ended up with a pretty nice workflow using [Yeoman][yeoman], [Grunt][grunt] and [Bower][bower] for managing the building/optimization etc.

[github-pages]: http://pages.github.com/
[jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.com/

[grunt]: http://gruntjs.com/
[bower]: http://bower.io/
