Just wanted to quickly post that I FINALLY got my jQuery GitHub badge updated and finally set up its own project page on GitHub. Demo, code and documentation can be found [here][jquerygithubbadge].

There are still tons of issues with it, mostly due to throttling from the API, but I got to finally mess around with sessionStorage, so it was a worthwhile endevour.
